# Project Overview
Independently established and executed a full pipeline for a .NET web application, highlighting my skills in cloud infrastructure, automation, and CI/CD processes. I designed and deployed a Kubernetes cluster using ECK, Terraform, Helm, and eksctl on AWS, comprising a 4-node setup with GitLab, Jenkins master, an agent, and a deployment instance. This project demonstrated my proficiency in integrating diverse technologies for an efficient, scalable software deployment environment.

This project is structured around Infrastructure as Code (IaaC) principles, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding. The key components of this project include:

- An EKS cluster with two nodes: one for Jenkins Master and one for the Jenkins Agent.
- An EC2 instance serving as a self-hosted GitLab.
- Another EC2 instance for deployment purposes.

## Setup Steps

Here's a summary of the setup steps and actions taken:

1. **Creating the EKS Cluster:**

   - Created the EKS cluster using `eksctl` with a configuration file `cluster.yaml`.
   - Initialized Terraform with `terraform init`.
   - Applied Terraform configurations with `terraform apply`.

2. **Setting Up GitLab:**

   - SSHed into one of the EC2 nodes (GITLAB).
   - Installed Docker and Docker Compose.
   - Ran the GitLab container using a Docker Compose file.
   - Created a script to retrieve the public IP of the instance and assign it to the GitLab configuration file.
   - Created a systemd service called `gitlab-config.service` to run the script on boot.

   Systemd Service Configuration (`gitlab-config.service`):
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Update GitLab Configuration
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/ubuntu/external_ip.py
   WorkingDirectory=/home/ubuntu
   Restart=no

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
## GitLab Setup

1. **Create a Non-Root User and Repository:**

   - Signed in to the root account on the EC2 GitLab instance.
   - Created a non-root user.
   - Approved the user and created a GitLab repository.
   - Generated a Personal Access Token (PAT).
   - Cloned the repository to my personal laptop using the following command:

     ```bash
     git clone http://44.201.4.72/ban898/project.git
     ```

   - Saved the cloned repository to a folder on my laptop.

2. **Create the DevOps Namespace and Installed Jenkins Helm Chart and CSI Driver:**

   - Applied the Kubernetes namespace configuration using:

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f devops-ns.yaml
     ```

   - Added the Jenkins Helm Chart repository:

     ```bash
     helm repo add jenkins https://charts.jenkins.io
     ```

   - Updated the Helm repositories:

     ```bash
     helm repo update
     ```

   - Installed the AWS EBS CSI driver for storage provisioning using:

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -k "github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/deploy/kubernetes/overlays/stable/ecr/?ref=master"
     ```

3. **Configure AWS Policies:**

   - Added and attached the following policies to the relevant IAM role:

     - AmazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy
     - AmazonEC2FullAccess

4. **Install a Customized Ingress Controller:**

   - Added the Helm chart repository for ingress-nginx:

     ```bash
     helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
     ```

   - Updated the Helm repositories:

     ```bash
     helm repo update
     ```

   - Installed the customized ingress-nginx Helm chart into the `kube-system` namespace and created the namespace if it doesn't exist:

     ```bash
     helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --namespace kube-system --create-namespace
     ```

   - Applied the `jenkins-ingress.yaml` configuration:

     ```bash
     kubectl apply -f jenkins-ingress.yaml
     ```

5. **Retrieved the DNS of the ELB:**

   - Retrieved the DNS of the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) using:

     ```bash
     kubectl get svc -n kube-system | grep ingress-nginx-controller
     ```

   - Added an ingress security rule on port 8080 to the ELB Security Group.

## Jenkins Configuration

6. **Login to Jenkins and Install Required Plugins:**

   - Logged in to Jenkins.
   - Installed the required plugins: git, gitlab, kubernetes, and Credentials.

7. **Add GitLab Token:**

   - Added a GitLab token to Jenkins for integration purposes.

8. **Create a Pipeline Job:**

   - Created a job of type pipeline named "Elta-test."
   - Retrieved the job endpoint for GitLab Integrations.

9. **Configure GitLab Integration:**

   - Configured a Jenkins Integration in GitLab with the relevant webhook.
   - Tested the connection and approved it.

## Deploy Instance

10. **Login to the Deploy Instance and Install Docker:**

    - Logged in to the deploy instance.
    - Installed Docker (same as previously).

11. **Create a Jenkinsfile for Pipeline:**

    - Created a Jenkinsfile that checks out, builds, pushes, and deploys with the correct configuration and variables.

12. **Push Jenkinsfile and Dockerfile:**

     Dockerfile:
     ```
        FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
	WORKDIR /app
	EXPOSE 80

	FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build
	WORKDIR /src
	COPY ["SimpleWebApp.csproj", "SimpleWebApp/"]
	COPY ["Program.cs", "SimpleWebApp/"]
	RUN dotnet restore "SimpleWebApp/SimpleWebApp.csproj"
	COPY . .
	RUN ls -l /src/SimpleWebApp
	WORKDIR "/src/SimpleWebApp"
	RUN dotnet build "SimpleWebApp.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

	FROM build AS publish
	RUN dotnet publish "SimpleWebApp.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

	FROM base AS final
	WORKDIR /app
	COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
	ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "SimpleWebApp.dll"]

     ```
     This Dockerfile is used to build a .NET-based web application container image. Here's a concise summary:

    - It starts with the ASP.NET 7.0 base image, sets the working directory, and exposes port 80.
    - It uses the SDK 7.0 image for building, copies project files, restores dependencies, and builds the app.
    - It creates a publish stage, publishes the app, and sets up a final stage.
    - In the final stage, it copies the published app and sets the entry point.
    
    Jenkinsfile:
    ```
    	pipeline {
   	agent {
        	label 'jenkins-jenkins-agent'
    	}
    	
    	environment {
        DOCKERHUB_REPO = 'simplewebapp'

                }
  

        stage('Push Docker Image to Docker Hub') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'Docker', usernameVariable: 'DOCKERHUB_USERNAME', passwordVariable: 'DOCKERHUB_PASS')]) {
                    script {
                        docker.withRegistry('https://index.docker.io/v1/', 'DOCKERHUB_USERNAME:DOCKERHUB_PASS') {
                            def dockerImage = docker.image("${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}/${DOCKERHUB_REPO}:${IMAGE_TAG}")
                            dockerImage.push()
                        }


        stage('Deploy Docker Container') {
            steps {
                sshagent(credentials: ['gitlab_key']) {
                    sh """
                        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no $REMOTE_HOST "
                            docker pull ${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}/${DOCKERHUB_REPO}:${IMAGE_TAG}
                            docker stop $CONTAINER_NAME || true
                            docker rm $CONTAINER_NAME || true
                            docker run --name $CONTAINER_NAME -d -p 8080:80 ${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}/${DOCKERHUB_REPO}:${IMAGE_TAG}

                        "
                    """
    ```
    
# Jenkins Pipeline Script

This Jenkins Pipeline script automates the build and deployment of a Dockerized application.

## Agent Configuration
- Uses a Jenkins agent labeled as 'jenkins-jenkins-agent' for execution.

## Environment Variables
- Sets environment variables for DockerHub repository, image tag, remote host, and container name.

## Stages
1. **Checkout SCM**
- Checks out the source code from the source code management system (SCM).

2. **Build Docker Image**
- Builds a Docker image using the specified DockerHub repository and image tag.

3. **Push Docker Image to Docker Hub**
- Pushes the built Docker image to Docker Hub.
- Uses Docker credentials stored in Jenkins credentials.

4. **Deploy Docker Container**
- SSHes into the remote host.
- Pulls the Docker image from Docker Hub.
- Stops and removes any existing containers with the same name.
- Runs a new Docker container with port mapping from 8080 to 80.

This Jenkins Pipeline automates the process of building a Docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, and deploying it to a remote host.


13. **Pushed the Jenkinsfile and the Dockerfile to the GitLab repository.**
14. **Triggered the Jenkins job to initiate the pipeline.**                    
    
    
    








# The breakdown of the directories and their purposes is as follows:

## 1. EKSCTL Directory (`eksctl`)

- **Purpose:** To set up our Kubernetes cluster.
- **Reasoning:** Using `eksctl` simplifies the creation of an EKS cluster and naturally implements IaaC, eliminating many complications that might arise if using Terraform alone for this task.

## 2. Terraform Directory (`tf`)

- **Purpose:** To handle configurations beyond the capabilities of `eksctl`.
- **Reasoning:** Terraform provides a robust IaaC approach and is used to cover additional configurations not handled by `eksctl`.

## 3. EC2-GitLab Directory (`ec2-gitlab`)

- **Purpose:** Contains all scripts and configuration files associated with the GitLab instance.
- **Note:** This setup includes a self-hosted container of GitLab CE on an EC2 instance outside of the Kubernetes cluster.

## 4. Kubernetes Directory (`k8s`)

- **Purpose:** Houses most Kubernetes objects necessary for the project.
  
### Helm Sub-directory (`Helm`)
  
- **Purpose:** Contains files pertinent to helm charts.
- **Reasoning:** Helm assists in managing Kubernetes applications through the use of Helm Charts.

## 5. Policy Directory (`policy`)

- **Purpose:** Manages custom policies.
- **Reasoning:** A manual policy was created and attached to an EKS role to facilitate the provisioning of an EBS volume.

## 6. ELTA Directory (`elta`)

- **Purpose:** Acts as the Source Code Management (SCM) in the project.
- **Contents:** A .NET Core web app created from its default template.
- **Integration:** The app is stored in a repository on the GitLab instance. Events in this directory are configured to trigger the Jenkins pipeline.
